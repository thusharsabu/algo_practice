# Problem statement
# In an encryption system where ASCII lower case letters represent numbers in the pattern a=1, b=2, c=3... and so on,
# find out all the codes that are possible for a given input number.

# Example 1

# number = 123
# codes_possible = ["aw", "abc", "lc"]
# Explanation: The codes are for the following number:

# 1 . 23 = "aw"
# 1 . 2 . 3 = "abc"
# 12 . 3 = "lc"
# Example 2

# number = 145
# codes_possible = ["ade", "ne"]
# Return the codes in a list. The order of codes in the list is not important.

# Note: you can assume that the input number will not contain any 0s

  arr
  while num is not 0:
